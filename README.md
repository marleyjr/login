# Login and Registration Page

A login, registration and home page for you to use in your project.

Contains a database with user, password and user access level, so you can define which levels each user can be using with example level 1, standard level 2 vip and level 3 administrator, soon I will make an admin page to edit and remove users.

Database login and password is: admin/admin
